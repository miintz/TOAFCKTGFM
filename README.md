TOAFCKTGFM
==========

**TOAFCKTGFM**, also known as *The Original And Fully Customizable Kinetic Typography Generator For Metal* is (hopefully) going to be my final assignment for the ITP course for the Media Technology master. 

I will attempt to explain now. It will be a bit mental, so bear with me:

- Kinetic Typography based on user input

The aim is to create something that allows someone to create a simple kinetic typography of his/her favorite song. Metal song. Not some crap modern hip-hop. I will make TOAFCKTGFM crash if you attempt loading something like that. Also expect your doorbell ringing, while seeing a black van parked outside.

Anyway:

- Syncing for lyrics and instruments 
 
The program will include a synchronization tool to sync lyrics via keyboard. That will be the first goal. After that i will try to include a tool to sync instruments. So you can give the snare drum a certain effect. Or give effects to certain notes. Something in that vein.

- Realtime

I'd like to create it so it is realtime. Meaning each run will look different. This could potentially fail horribly, because i dont know about the capabilities of Processing. Maybe this is all a bit too much. If it doesn't work, i will probably create a renderer that outputs movie files. 


**IMPORTANT**

Before running this install the following libs:

- geomerative
- Shapes3D
- g4p

(list will grow)

Also, i'm not liable for anything. If you think the final product is amazing and you go a bit wild and, i don't know, manage to mash up your deck and in progress demolish your favorite CD (limited edition) of your favorite band than well, i feel for you, but can't help you. 


Ok that's the formal stuff out of the way. I'm going to have a go now.

If you are still with me at this point, here are some features i may implement in the future: 

- Support for video clips

Wouldn't it be cool if this program automagically retrieved a video clip for the render? 

- Customizable dynamic backgrounds and color palettes

Different brands of music (metal) call for different kinds of background and colors. So yeah. Might implement that.

- Shape definition

Since Shape3D supports some kind of Shape editor, i might use that and create something that allows the user to create his/her own shapes and sync them to parts of the song. Tricky but possible i think.
