TOAFCKTGFM
==========

**TOAFCKTGFM**, also known as *The Original And Fully Customizable Kinetic Typography Generator For Metal* is (hopefully) going to be my final assignment for the ITP course for the Media Technology master. 

I will attempt to explain now. It will be a bit mental, so bear with me:

- Kinetic Typography based on user input

The aim is to create something that allows someone to create a simple kinetic typography of his/her favorite song. Metal song. Not some crap modern hip-hop. I will make TOAFCKTGFM crash if you attempt loading something like that. Also expect your doorbell ringing, while seeing a black van parked outside.

Anyway:

- Syncing for lyrics and instruments 
 
The program will include a synchronization tool to sync lyrics via keyboard. That will be the first goal. After that i will try to include a tool to sync instruments. So you can give the snare drum a certain effect. Or give effects to certain notes. Something in that vein.

- Realtime

I'd like to create it so it is realtime. Meaning each run will look different. This could potentially fail horribly, because i dont know about the capabilities of Processing. Maybe this is all a bit too much. If it doesn't work, i will probably create a renderer that outputs movie files. 

Ok that's it. I'm going to attempt it now.
